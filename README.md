#A simple Python IRC client.
This is a proof of concept python IRC client. While there are other IRC clients written in python, this one was written to be only an IRC client.

Most of the code was taken and tweaked from the following websites.
- For the base IRC functionality. http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/h/1968
- For the SSL capability. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817963/creating-a-very-simple-irc-bot-with-ssl

For now, the IRC client will print out everything it receives. In the future, it should follow basic IRC rules and be able to print out only what the user wants.
