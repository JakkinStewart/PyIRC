#A simple Python IRC client.
This is a proof of concept python IRC client. While there are other IRC clients written in python, this one was written to plainly show a simple IRC client in python.

Most of the code was taken and tweaked from the following websites.
- For the base IRC functionality. http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/h/1968
- For the SSL capability. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817963/creating-a-very-simple-irc-bot-with-ssl

For now, the IRC client will print out everything it receives. In the future, it should be able to print out only what the user wants.
