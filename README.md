#A simple Python IRC client.
This is a proof of concept python IRC client. While there are many other IRC clients written in python, this is designed to be a logger, rather than enourmously functional client like XChat or mIRC.

Most of the code was taken and tweaked from the following websites.
- For the base IRC functionality. http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/h/1968
- For the SSL capability. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817963/creating-a-very-simple-irc-bot-with-ssl

For now, the IRC client will print out everything it receives. In the future, it should follow basic IRC protocols and be able to print out only what the user wants.
