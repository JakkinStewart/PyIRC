#A simple Python IRC client.
This is a proof of concept python IRC client. While there are many other IRC clients written in python, this is designed to be a bot, rather than enourmously functional client like XChat or mIRC.

Most of the code was taken and tweaked from the following websites.
- For the base IRC functionality. http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/h/1968
- For the SSL capability. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817963/creating-a-very-simple-irc-bot-with-ssl

For now, the IRC client will print out everything it receives while saving it to a file. It can find data on urls and it possesses the ability to provide tutorials. It is being developed for the Information Security Student Organization (ISSO) at MNSU.
