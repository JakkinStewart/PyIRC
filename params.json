While there are many other IRC clients written in python, this is designed to be a bot, rather than enourmously functional client like XChat or mIRC.\r\n\r\nMost of the code was taken and tweaked from the following websites.\r\n- For the base IRC functionality. http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/h/1968\r\n- For the SSL capability. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817963/creating-a-very-simple-irc-bot-with-ssl\r\n\r\nFor now, the IRC client will print out everything it receives while saving it to a file. It can find data on urls and it possesses the ability to provide tutorials.",
