# This program is designed to be a simple demonstration of a Python IRC client with SSL capabilities.
# From http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459#section-3.3.2:
# The IRC protocol is a text-based protocol, with the simplest client being any socket program capable of connecting to the server.

# In its current stage, this IRC client fulfills the "simplest client" criteria. In the future, it will be updated to follow IRC client protocol and parse messages from IRC servers more cleanly.
